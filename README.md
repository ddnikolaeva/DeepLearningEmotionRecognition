# Emotion recognition from images using Deep Learning tools (Keras, TensorFlow)

This project is a part of final exam for the subject Digital Forensics in University of Padua (Italy) held during the 2022/2023 academic year.

The project focuses on developing a neural network for emotion recognition using the dataset FER-2013:

We developed a system that can accurately recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions.

For this task we used TensorFlow and Keras tools for creating a Deep Learning model and DLIB library for data pre-processing.

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
