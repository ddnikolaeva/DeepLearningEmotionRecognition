# Emotion recognition from images using Deep Learning tools (Keras, TensorFlow)

This project is a part of final exam for the subject Digital Forensics in University of Padua (Italy) held during the 2022/2023 academic year.

The project focuses on developing a neural network for emotion recognition using the dataset FER-2013:

We developed a system that can accurately recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions.

For this task we used TensorFlow and Keras tools for creating a Deep Learning model and DLIB library for data pre-processing.

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.

In this repository you will find the dataset, source code, final neural network and project presentation in pdf format.
